Why all that? 
- i was bored

About me: 
- i try to learn Reverse-Engeneering and i learnd alot from this tool (thanks)

What can i do to avoid people "cracking" my exe?
- Compile your exe with "Nuitka", that should help with people dumping the code

Where do i start if the file is a exe? 
- upload the exe to: https://pyinstxtractor-web.netlify.app/
- download the zip archive, then check for a .pyc file with the name of the exe
- Then upload this .pyc file to: https://www.pylingual.io/
- You will get the fully obfuscated source code, paste it into a file to save it
- From there you can start using my deobfuscator and get the source code
